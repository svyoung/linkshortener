        <h4>About Me</h4>
          <img src="/images/about_profile.jpg" class="aboutpic"><p>Hello and welcome to my humble virtual abode. My name is Sam and I am a self trained web and software developer. I started out as a front end designer back in 2002 when I decided to learn HTML and CSS. During high school to college in 2006 is when I returned to web development and had a further interest in dynamic back end technologies and played around with PHP using Wordpress. </p>

          <p>It wasn't until I began job hunting after college (a psychology major btw) that I actually delved deeper into software. I got an entry-level first web-dev job that allowed me to tinker and expand my knowledge. I am now a full stack developer with experience in PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, JavaScript/jquery, along with many other technologies. Besides web development, I am also skilled in art such as drawing and animation, whether it is traditional or digitial. Please take a look at my resume if you are interested in more!</p>
